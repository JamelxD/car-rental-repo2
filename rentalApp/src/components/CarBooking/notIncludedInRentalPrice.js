            <p>Local Charges<br />
                This section shows charges that you&rsquo;ll pay at the counter because of (a) where you're picking your car up, (b) who's driving, and (c) where you go during your rental. It doesn&rsquo;t show other over-the-counter costs, such as charges for fuel, child seats or additional services.</p>

            <p><div style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Fines</div><br />
                You are responsible for any charges and fines, including tolls, congestion charges, speeding tickets and parking or traffic fines.</p>

            <p>Additional drivers<br />
                The main driver (the person named on the booking) must be present when you pick the car up, and must be the one who pays anything charged at the counter. There may be a daily fee for additional drivers. The rental terms, including age-related restrictions and fees, apply to any additional drivers.</p>

            <p>An additional driver fee will apply for any additional driver: $15.00 per day, including tax, up to a maximum of $250.00 per rental.</p>

            <p>Roadside assistance<br />
                You may have to pay extra for any emergency roadside assistance that your rental company provides. When you pick your car up, please make sure you find out where the relevant paperwork is kept. In most cases, it&rsquo;ll be in the glove box or attached to the sun visor.</p>

            </p>
            <p>If you&rsquo;ve incurred any charges, such as speeding tickets or unpaid congestion charges, the car hire company will try to contact you when the authorities ask them who was driving. This could be months after your rental &ndash; and you&rsquo;ll have to pay the company&rsquo;s administration fee as well as the original charge.</p>
