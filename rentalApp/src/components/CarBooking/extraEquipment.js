                As explained during the booking process, extras (child seats, GPS, etc.) will be either:</p>

            <p>
                <AddIcon />included in the cost of your rental, or<br />
                <AddIcon />ordered and paid for when booking your car, or<br />
                <AddIcon />requested when booking your car and paid for at pick-up (in which case, we can&rsquo;t guarantee that they&rsquo;ll be available, or that the price will be the same).</p>

            <p>Extra Equipment Conditions<br />
                Additional extras will be subject to any applicable sales taxes and location taxes.</p>

            <p>If an extra is lost, damaged or stolen, you'll pay a replacement fee.</p>

            <p>If the car is picked up in one location and dropped off in another, the rental company may charge a One-Way Fee to cover the cost of returning an extra to the original location.</p>

            <p>Please note: counter staff aren&rsquo;t trained (or allowed) to fit baby / child / booster seats. You will need to fit these yourself.</p>

            <p>Additional drivers<br />
                The car hire company&rsquo;s age-related charges and restrictions will apply to all additional drivers.</p>
