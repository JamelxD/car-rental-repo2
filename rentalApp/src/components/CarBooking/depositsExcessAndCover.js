            <p>Cover information<br />
                When you pick the car up, please make sure you read any terms and conditions before signing the rental agreement, including any terms of additional products you may purchase at the counter. It's very important that you understand the agreement/policy&rsquo;s exclusions and limits, as well as the rules about anything you pay for at the rental counter.</p>

            <p>Deposit / Excess<br />
                The rental company will require a security deposit of $1,281.90 when you pick your car up. The deposit will be returned after the rental, as long as all conditions have been met.</p>

            <p>The car has a theft excess of $0.00 including tax.</p>

            <p>There is no excess for the coverage provided by the car hire company&rsquo;s CDW policy.</p>

            <p>The damage excess only applies to parts of the car that are covered by your car&rsquo;s Collision Damage Waiver policy. If other parts of the car (such as windscreen, tyres and undercarriage) are damaged, you will pay the full repair cost.</p>

            <p>When you pick your car up, the counter staff will require a security deposit for the car. They may also require a security deposit for fuel in the tank and for certain extras (e.g. a child seat or GPS). After your rental, your deposit(s) will be returned.</p>

            <p>Due to fluctuating foreign exchange rates and other possible banking charges, the car hire company cannot be held responsible for any difference between the amount paid and the amount refunded.</p>

            <p>The Collision Damage Waiver and Theft Protection policies come with an &lsquo;excess&rsquo;. The excess is the amount that you will need to pay before the policy covers the rest of the cost (for anything the policy covers).</p>

            <p>Additional Cover<br />
                At the car hire counter, you may decide to buy additional cover to reduce or remove your excess, or to cover things your Collision Damage Waiver (CDW) doesn't, such as tyres and windscreen.<br />
                Please note: If you do, the contract will be between you and the rental company &ndash; so you&rsquo;ll need to contact them if you're dissatisfied with the policy or the cover it provides.</p>

            <p>If you&rsquo;re involved in a 'single vehicle accident' and/or the bodywork is particularly badly damaged, the excess will be higher.</p>

            <p>Cover Arrangements<br />
                Please make sure you read the terms and conditions of the cover you receive when signing the rental agreement at pick-up, to find out about the policy&rsquo;s exclusions and limits.<br />
                Policies normally exclude things such as windscreens, glass, wheels, tyres, undercarriage, interior, personal belongings, towing charges &amp; off-road time &ndash; as well as any &lsquo;extra equipment&rsquo; hired from the car hire company, such as child seats and GPS devices.<br />
                Note that your cover will be invalidated by negligence, refuelling errors or breaking the terms of the rental agreement (for example, by driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs).</p>

            <p>Administration Charges<br />
                Damage to the car will be charged for by the car hire company after it is dropped off - and will incur a Damage Administration fee on top of the amount deducted from the excess.</p>

            <p>An Immobilisation Charge is payable in the event of an accident. This is in addition to the amount deducted from the excess and is compulsory. This charge is calculated against the car group and the number of repair days.</p>

            <p>If the car is damaged or stolen, the rental company will charge an administration fee. If you pay for damage/theft with a credit card, they'll charge an additional administration fee.</p>

            <p>Once the rental is completed, customers need to return to the rental office to ask for a refund of the deposit. The deposit has to be repaid against the same payment card originally used.</p>
