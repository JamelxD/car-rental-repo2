            <p>Important information<br />
                By making this booking, you&rsquo;re confirming that you have read and accept the rental terms.</p>

            <p>At the rental counter, customers will also sign a rental agreement before they give you the key. It&rsquo;s important that you read that agreement carefully - and if anything isn&rsquo;t clear, discuss it with the counter staff before you sign.</p>

            <p>You rental company reserves the right to refuse a car if, in the counter staff&rsquo;s opinion, the driver is unfit to drive or anyone in the group is threatening, abusive or in any way endangering the health and safety of other people. If this happens, you will not be entitled to any refund or compensation.</p>

            <p>Please see &lsquo;What you need at pick-up&rsquo; above - and note that the counter staff will not provide a car unless all requirements (age, driving licence, payment card, documentation, etc.) are met. If this happens, you will not be entitled to any refund or compensation.</p>

            <p>Before you drive off, you must check the car and make sure that any damage is reported to the counter staff and noted on the rental agreement. Otherwise, you may end up being liable for that damage.</p>

            <p><div style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Road rules</div><br />
                When you rent a car, you are agreeing to use it responsibly. You must not:</p>

            <p>drive under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or any other type of narcotic substances<br />
                transport any inflammable or dangerous goods, or any toxic, corrosive, radioactive or otherwise harmful substances<br />
                carry anything which, because of its smell and/or condition, could damage the car or cause the rental company to lose time or money<br />
                transport live animals<br />
                install a roof rack, luggage carrier or anything similar, unless supplied by the rental company<br />
                rent the car to anyone else<br />
                carry passengers for hire or reward (taxi)<br />

            <p>Seatbelt - Whatever country you&rsquo;re driving in, driver and passengers must wear seatbelts if fitted, wherever they&rsquo;re sitting in the car.</p>

            <p>Please be aware that all cars have a non-smoking policy. Fines will apply if this policy is not adhered to.</p>

            <p>To make sure you understand the rules and laws about driving hire cars at home and abroad, it&rsquo;s essential you read the Terms &amp; Conditions in full before you leave to pick your car up.</p>

            <p>In particular, please make sure you know what documents and other paperwork you must take with you (e.g. driving licence, forms of identification, and payment cards) and what you&rsquo;ll need to pay for at the car hire counter. If you don&rsquo;t have everything you need, the car hire company may not let you pick the car up.</p>

            <p>If you intend to do any city driving, there may be traffic restrictions based on your car&rsquo;s licence plate, so please tell the counter staff when you go to pick up your car.</p>

            <p><div style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>On the road</div><br />
                Accident or Breakdown - In the event of a breakdown, accident or mechanical difficulties, you must call the car hire company immediately. They must give authority for repairs or replacement cars. Please keep copies of all documentation you are asked to complete. This may be needed if you wish to make a claim. For accidents, a police report and an incident report from the car hire counter will be required.</p>

            <p>If you are having any problems with your rental car, please call the rental company.</p>

            <p>Car Hire Company Important Information<br />
                Failure to return the Vehicle within 72 hours of the expiration of the rental period may constitute a criminal offense, and subject you to the maximum penalty for theft of a motor vehicle, a second-degree felony that is punishable by a fine and / or imprisonment.</p>

            <p><div style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Price calculation</div><br />
                Please note that exchange rates can fluctuate - and no-one in the car rental industry can do anything about this. As a result, you might find that charges on your statement aren&rsquo;t an exact match with the price you were told while booking. The same goes for any refund you may receive.</p>

            <p>Price Calculation - Prices are based on the pick-up and drop-off times and dates that you agree before your rental starts. If you pick the car up any later or bring it back any earlier, you will not receive a refund for unused time.</p>

            <p>If, at pick-up, you choose to take a different car, there may be an additional charge for this &ndash; even if the new car is smaller than the one you had booked.</p>

            <p><div style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Penalty fees</div><br />
                An Immobilisation Charge is payable in the event of an accident. This is in addition to the amount deducted from the excess and is compulsory. This charge is calculated against the car group and the number of repair days.</p>

            <p>Lost Keys - If you lose your key(s), you will be charged the cost of replacement.</p>

            <p>If you've not returned the car after your agreed drop-off time, the insurance will no longer be valid. Plus, you will be charged a penalty fee as well as the cost of another day's rental.</p>

            <p><div style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Grace period</div><br />
                You must be at the rental counter by your pick-up time: if you&rsquo;re late, the car may no longer be available, and you won&rsquo;t be entitled to a refund. If you think you might be late, it's vital that you contact the rental company at least 30 minutes before your pick-up time, even if it's because of a flight delay and you&rsquo;ve provided your flight number.</p>

            <p>In the event that the booked vehicle is not collected or not collected at the agreed time, the rental charge already paid shall be withheld in full.</p>

            <p><div style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Valeting</div><br />
                The car hire company will charge you if the car needs more than a reasonable amount of cleaning after your rental.</p>
